# PyPI packages analysis
Analysis of the dependency graph based on wheel metadata for packages available on PyPI. Information is extracted from the BigQuery public datasets and processed to adress the question of whether marking packages as **critical** based on _downloads_ is the best idea or if it requires a twist.

This was developed as a final work for FIUBA's 7530 - Algorithms Theory II course by Mart√≠n Buchwald.
